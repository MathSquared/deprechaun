Toying with depreciation for US income taxes.

This project, when complete, will aim to help compute depreciation on business assets, according to the methods set by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for income taxes.

**Note.** I'm neither an accountant nor a lawyer, but a programmer with too much time on my hands. The Internal Revenue Code is complicated (meaning I might get it wrong) and often-changing (meaning it might change before I update this program). I'm writing this software for my own accounting, and it does well enough for me, but I can't guarantee that it will do well enough for you.
